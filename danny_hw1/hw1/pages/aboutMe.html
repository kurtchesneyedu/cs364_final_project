    <h1 class="Class 1">About me: Danny Detjen</h1>
    <p>My go-by name is Danny. I am originally from Draper, Utah and come from a family of 5. <br>
    I am majoring in Computer Science &lpar;As most students are in this course&rpar; and minoring in Philosphy.
    <br>I also swim for USAFA, I swim sprint/mid-distance freestyle and butterfly. This does not leave
    much time for other hobbies. </p>
    <h2>Here is a photo of me in Service Dress:</h2>

    <p>Despite the amount of time that swim takes, I still squeeze some other items into my schedule. <br>
    I love to cook, my favorite dish is a coconut curry I have been making for years. I also am really <br>
    into puzzles and love hiking. I also spend a lot of time on the phone with my girlfriend who goes <br>
    to USNA and spend most of my free weekends trying to see her. <br>I plan on doing Cyber Operations &lpar;17X&rpar;
    in the Air Force. </p>
    <h3>Here are photos of me at swim practice and sailing at USNA:</h3>
